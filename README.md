# Python-AoA-demo

## Overview

The Python application provides an alternative visualization of the AoA results. This application processes the Angle of Arrival obtained by the antenna and estimates the position of the tag on a 2D grid assuming that the antenna is a known height above the tag “plane”.

## Usage

The following Python modules must be installed for the first use of the program:
* **pyserial**
* **parse**
* **event-notifier**
Then run aoa_demo.py
